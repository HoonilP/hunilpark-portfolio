<objective>
Build the Experience and Education sections using the Timeline component, then compose all 7 sections into the main page.

Purpose: Complete the main page with career history and education credentials, then wire everything together so the user sees the full portfolio on a single scroll. This is the final plan of Phase 3.
Output: Two section components (ExperienceSection, EducationSection), bilingual translation keys, and updated page.tsx composing all sections.

  <name>Task 2: Create ExperienceSection, EducationSection, and compose page.tsx</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/ExperienceSection.tsx, src/components/sections/EducationSection.tsx, src/app/[locale]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    **ExperienceSection.tsx:**
    - Async server component using `getTranslations('Experience')`
    - Section id="experience" with py-20 padding, max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4
    - Section title (h2) from t('sectionTitle'), text-3xl font-bold md:text-4xl mb-8
    - Import Timeline and TimelineItem from '@/components/ui/Timeline' (or '@/components/ui')
    - Build TimelineItem array from translation keys, ordered most recent first:
      1. dyCms (2024-2025)
      2. paymentInApp (2022-2024)
      3. dyAccounting (2017-2018)
    - Each item: { date: t('key.date'), title: t('key.title'), description: t('key.description') }
    - Render: `<Timeline items={experiences} />`
    - This satisfies EXP-01 (timeline format), EXP-02 (DY consolidated), EXP-03 (Payment In-App), EXP-04 (bilingual)

    **EducationSection.tsx:**
    - Async server component using `getTranslations('Education')`
    - Section id="education" with py-20 padding, max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4
    - Section title (h2) from t('sectionTitle'), text-3xl font-bold md:text-4xl mb-8
    - **Education timeline:** Use Timeline component for university info:
      1. sangmyung (2024-2026)
      2. yangon (2017-2018)
    - **Certifications & Awards section:** After timeline, add:
      - Subtitle h3: t('certificationsTitle'), text-xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-4
      - Render certifications as a simple list of Badge-styled items or a flex-wrap grid:
        - Each cert from t('certifications.computerSkills'), t('certifications.accounting'), etc.
        - Use a simple ul/li with neutral text styling, or render as a flex row of Badges
        - Recommendation: Use a clean list with bullet-free styling (space-y-2, text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400)
    - **Activities section:** Similar subtitle + list for BAY and AI course
    - Import Timeline from '@/components/ui/Timeline', Badge from '@/components/ui/Badge'

    **page.tsx (REWRITE):**
    - Replace entire content of src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
    - Keep the same function signature (async, params with locale)
    - Keep setRequestLocale(locale) call for static rendering
    - Remove the old placeholder content (the centered title/subtitle/description/comingSoon)
    - Import and compose all 7 sections in order:
      ```tsx
      import HeroSection from '@/components/sections/HeroSection';
      import AboutSection from '@/components/sections/AboutSection';
      import SkillsSection from '@/components/sections/SkillsSection';
      import ProjectsSection from '@/components/sections/ProjectsSection';
      import ExperienceSection from '@/components/sections/ExperienceSection';
      import EducationSection from '@/components/sections/EducationSection';
      import ContactSection from '@/components/sections/ContactSection';
      ```
    - Render as simple vertical stack (no extra wrapper needed, layout.tsx already provides flex-1 main):
      ```tsx
      return (
        <>
          <HeroSection />
          <AboutSection />
          <SkillsSection />
          <ProjectsSection />
          <ExperienceSection />
          <EducationSection />
          <ContactSection />
        </>
      );
      ```
    - Remove the old getTranslations('Home') import since Home keys are no longer needed on main page
    - Keep setRequestLocale for SSG support
    - The page.tsx should NOT use getTranslations itself — each section handles its own translations

    **Important:** Ensure page.tsx still accepts params and calls setRequestLocale(locale) for static rendering to work.

    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
